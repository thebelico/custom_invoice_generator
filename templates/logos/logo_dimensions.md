To maintain the same structure as presented in this template, it is recommended to maintain the image's aspect ratio, which is approximately 1:5.25.

It is calculated by dividing the length (3.3") by the height (0.6").

Calculation:
Aspect ratio = Length / Height, Aspect ratio = 3.3" / 0.6, Aspect ratio ≈ 5.5.
Therefore, the ratio is approximately 1:5.5, which means that for every unit of height, there are approximately 5.5 units of length.


Specifically for this template, we used an image that is 0.63" by 3.31" long, so its ratio is 1:5.25.

To avoid OCD, the image measures: 717px × 135px, which gives us an aspect ratio of 1:5.31px.

So as you can see, it's a bit complicated to define.

However, the default styles in this repository will rescale to a maximum of 190px long by 40px high, so please take this into account for high-quality or high-detail images.
